\chapter{Presentation of the project}

The evolution of computer architectures led to the widespread of the
heterogeneous ones: those containing a multi-core CPU (often with non-uniform
memory access, NUMA) associated to a set of accelerators such as graphic
processing units (GPU), synergistic processing units (SPU), Xeon PHI, etc.
Programming these architectures is challenging because each unit has its own
features and the whole computer can be any combination of different units. In
addition, the way the units are interconnected is a factor that has to be taken
into account too.

The ViperVM project aims at providing an environment to implement and test
programming models, scheduling algorithms, data management policies, etc. This
document presents the different steps that have led to the current design. It
should evolve at the same pace than the software. 

I hope you will enjoy it! Any comment on this document is appreciated and should
be sent to me (Sylvain Henry, \url{hsyl20@gmail.com}).
