In this chapter we will add support for OpenCL device memories.

\summary{
In this chapter we added support for dynamic linking with the OpenCL library and
memory management (\texttt{allocate} and \texttt{release}) into OpenCL devices.
We introduced \texttt{Link} and \texttt{Region} types, we added a method to list
available memories in a platform and we provided a method to perform data
transfers on links.
