= Kernel fusion =

Suppose we have a chain of kernels: A -> B -> C -> D
whose intermediate data are not used by any other kernel.
Sometimes this can be replaced by a more efficient kernel that performs the whole operation.
It avoids uncessary runtime system overhead between kernel executions (scheduling decisions, etc.)

* statically we can use rewrite rules to do it
